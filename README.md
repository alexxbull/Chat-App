# Chat App
My attempt at creating a multithreaded chat application in Python. 

### NOTE
* The code is written to default to localhost for the server and client
* When using the GUI on the client side, pressing the enter key can be used to send messages instead of the "Send" button.

### Goals
- [x] make basic chat app (command line)
- [x] implement a GUI
- [ ] make a more fancy GUI
- [ ] clean up code
