# Chat Room
My attempt at creating a multithreaded chat application in Python. 

### NOTE
* The code is written to default to localhost for the server and client
* When using the GUI on the client side, pressing the enter key can be used to send messages instead of the "Send" button.

### BUGS
* The GUI scripts will continue running in the OS as a process unless manually terminated in the OS (i.e: Task Manager) 

### SCREENSHOTS
